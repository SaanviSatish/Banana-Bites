You need to:
1) Peel the banana and trim off the ends. Chop the flesh into 6 pieces
2) Break the chocolate into a heatproof bowl. Put the bowl over a pan of warm water to melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally. Leave to cool slightly
3) Push a straw through the banana, then drizzle melted chocolate over each piece. (Don't worry if it's not perfect - it still tastes delicious!)
4) Roll the chocolate-covered banana in the coconut ot sprinkles. Let the chocolate harden, then serve
